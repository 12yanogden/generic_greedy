# generic_greedy
A generic greedy algorithm written in C. Accepts an array of data and a lambda. Uses the lambda to order the data in a valid path. It uses each element of the data as the starting node. Returns k number of solutions (eg. if k is 100 and 10 solutions are found, 10 solutions are returned) The solutions are sorted, depending on if the lambda means to minimize or maximize the cost of the path.
